%Cellular processes are driven by networks of biological reactions. Cells rely on the tight coordination of these pathways to achieve proper functioning.
%With the help of signaling pathway, a cell senses changes in its environnement or internal state. This information is then passed on via cascades of biochemical 
%reactions to the appropriate mechanisms which respond by modifying the metabolic and transcriptiona activities. this in turn modifies the behavior of the cell.

%Consequently, the dynamics of biopathways play a crucial role in determinig cellular functions.

%Examples: circadian rhythm, the apoptosis pathway inducing programmed cell death, cell differentiation.
